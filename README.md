ECE Senior Design Project - Development of Low-Cost RF Data Communication System
==============

Abstract
--------------
A Low-cost Radio Frequency (RF) Data Communication System has been recently developed to custom design RF specification and to evaluate any waveform performances under realistic condition. With this communication system, any model-based design waveform can be programmed to an Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG) and transmit through the RF modules. The RF Data Communication System is built upon single-board microtrollersâ€”Arduino and Ultra low power 2.4GHz RF Transceivers to communicate wirelessly in digital form. This system architecture provided a low-cost solution in building custom RF system with low-cost and easily accessible electronics components including Arduino to meet the RF design specification. As a result, students and researchers were able to produce a low-cost Data Communication System to support studies of RF waveforms. The characteristics of the RF system are studied and the Error Analysis of the test signals are provided.
